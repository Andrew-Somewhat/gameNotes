Nature of Earth {
    Earts nature is that of minerals.
    Earth base is solid.
    Earth as an element encompasses minerals and other solid inorganics.
    [
        Earth is an odd elemancy, since the element encompasses such a broad range of matter, 
        it is hard to fully identify the conditions needed to be met for earth to manifest,
        what is known is that the periodic elements need to be present for a specific mineral to manifest
        however magicules can be used as a substatute for some if not all periodic elements
